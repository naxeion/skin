# Skin

Skin is a command-line tool designed for managing and applying skinners to manage commands and targets. It provides various subcommands to control the activation, deactivation, status check, and configuration of targets.

Through Skinners, you can hide commands in different ways, with limits on execution.

## Installation

To install Skin, you can use Cargo, Rust's package manager:

```bash
cargo install rskin
```
