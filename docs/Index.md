Skin is a versatile command-line tool designed for managing and applying skinners to targets. It provides a wide range of functionalities, including activating, deactivating, checking status, running commands, installing skinners, and configuring targets.

Through Skinners, you can customize the behavior of commands, set execution limits, and even create your own Skinners. Skin currently does not support all platforms.
